      "        The tripping characteristic of 3RV10 / 3RV20 / 3RV21 motor starter protectors is primarily designed for protecting three-phase motors.\n",
      "        The rated current In of the motor to be protected (see nameplate) is set on the setting\n",
      "        scale. The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top value on the setting scale). This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device.\n",
      "        The phase loss sensitivity (not in the case of 3RV20..-.....-0DA0, 3RV23, 3RV27 and 3RV28) of the motor starter protector ensures that it trips in good time in the event of a phase failure or significant phase unbalance. The motor starter protector tripping prevents overcurrents from occurring in the remaining phases, thus preventing damage to the load.\n",
      "        System protection\n",
      "        3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        To prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the load applied to each of the three current paths of the motor starter protector in standard version must always be the same. With single-phase loads, the current paths must be connected in series. There are also motor starter protectors 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 without phase loss sensitivity specially developed for system protection. The 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 motor starter protectors for system protection do not have UL approval and are only suitable for applications according to IEC.\n",
      "        3RV27 and 3RV28 circuit breakers are also suitable for protecting systems. The devices do not possess any phase failure detection and are also approved as Circuit Breaker in accordance with UL 489 or CSA C22.2 No.5.\n",
      "        Motor protection with overload relay function\n",
      "        3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function have the same overload and short- circuit release characteristic as 3RV20 motor starter protectors. However, the overload releases have no effect on the motor starter protectors' breaker latching mechanism. In the event of an overload, the motor starter protector remains on.\n",
      "        The overload release is linked to two auxiliary contacts (1 NO contact + 1 NC contact) mounted on the side; these are switched in the event of an overload. The auxiliary contacts can be evaluated or can be used to disconnect a downstream contactor. The auxiliary contacts are reset automatically once the motor starter protector has cooled down. In the overload range the motor starter protector with overload relay function does not protect itself. Provision has to be made, therefore, to ensure that the current is safely disconnected by a downstream switching device such as a contactor. Note\n",
      "        Fixed connection: Auxiliary contacts with motor starter protector\n",
      "        The auxiliary contacts are connected to the right-hand side of the motor starter protector. The connection is fixed and cannot be removed.\n",
      "        This means that auxiliary releases cannot be mounted on the right-hand side of 3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function.\n",
      "        General information on the startup characteristics of highly energy- efficient motors (IE3 / IE4)\n",
      "        Motor starter protectors have been conceived to protect and switch motors. They assume the task of line protection in the event of an overload or short-circuit.\n",
      "        To this end, motor starter protectors are equipped with sensors for overload and short-circuit detection and possess an interruption point for switching motor and short-circuit currents. Without technical adaptation to the new highly energy-efficient motors (IE3 / IE4), the problems described below can arise.\n",
      "        Short-circuit detection\n",
      "        In the event of unusually high currents in the electrical installation, short-circuit detection serves to keep the thermal and dynamic load low and ensure safe shutdown. The response threshold should lie above the currents that a starting motor causes. The dimensioning of a system is influenced by the response value. The higher the response value, the higher the chosen cable cross-sections to be protected must be. This increases costs in the system and for the switching devices. This is why the response values have been adapted to the previously typical motor starting currents. The drawback of the new, more efficient motors (IE3 / IE4) is that, on average, the starting currents and magnetization currents (inrush currents) arising at the moment of switching on are considerably higher than in the case of the previous generations of motors. The spread of locked rotor and inrush currents is very wide. Motors with high values can therefore cause the motor starter protector's short-circuit detection to respond. This leads to unintentional shutdown (\"early tripping\") during motor starting. Early tripping can occur whenever the motor current lies in the top range of the motor starter protector's setting scale and a motor with a high inrush current is used.\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity of motor starter protectors\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity tests are conducted in compliance with the standard under three- phase AC loading with 10 to 8 times the rated current. In some cases, the starting and inrush currents of IE3 / IE4 motors are clearly above these values. In isolated cases, current spikes that arise during switching on can cause brief lifting of the contacts without triggering a breaking operation by short-circuit detection. This can lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Where the motor is switched on by a contactor, for example, the motor starter protector's making/breaking capacity is irrelevant. In this case, the motor current is only carried. The current that can be carried without any problems is normally higher than the switching device's making/breaking capacity. This should not lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Rated motor current/setting scale\n",
      "        For motor protection, the motor's rated current must be set on the motor starter protector's setting scale. The new IE3 / IE4 motors generally have lower rated currents. This can lead to situations in which a motor starter protector with a lower rated current has to be chosen for the same motor rating. Thus, the short-circuit detection (Page 67) response value also drops and can lead to tripping during motor starting.\n",
      "        Optimization of 3RV1011 and 3RV2 motor starter protectors for IE3 / IE4 motors\n",
      "        The motor starter protectors have been revised in relation to the higher locked rotor currents and inrush currents as follows:\n",
      "        • Raising of the lower short-circuit detection response tolerances without changes to the maximum values.\n",
      "        → No change of customer-end system dimensioning.\n",
      "        • Adaptation of making/breaking capacity.\n",
      "        → For necessary restrictions of maximum locked rotor currents, see the chapter entitled \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\".\n",
      "        • Adaptation of some motor starter protector versions' overload releases and setting scales. → Avoidance of using smaller motor starter protectors due to lower rated motor currents (see chapter \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\")\n",
      "        In the case of motors with very high locked rotor and inrush currents, problems can arise despite adaptations, e.g. undesired tripping on starting. It is recommended that motor starter protectors be selected such that the setting does not need to be made in the upper range of the setting scale. This reduces power loss in the device (cost saving and reduced temperature rise in the control cabinet) and increases the distance from the short-circuit releases' response limits.\n",
      "        Selection example (size S0)\n",
      "        Rated motor current: 15 A\n",
      "        Motor starter protector A: Setting scale 10 ... 16 A Motor starter protector B: Setting scale 13 ... 20 A\n",
      "        → Recommended motor starter protector 13 ... 20 A because of reduced power loss and greater distance from response limits.\n",
      "        In the calculation example, the power loss in the case of motor starter protector B is lower by about 35 % than in the case of motor starter protector A.\n",
      "        The short-circuit releases' response limits always refer to the maximum set value.\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector A, the short-circuit release's response value is 208 A (13 · 16 A).\n",
      "        When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 13.86 times the current setting (208 A/15 A =13.86).\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector B, the short-circuit release's response limit is 260 A\n",
      "        (13 · 20 A). When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 17.33 times the current setting (260 A/15 A = 17.33).\n",
      "        In this example, the distance from the response limit of 13.86 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector A increases to 17.33 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector B.\n",
      "        3RV23 MSP for starter combinations\n",
      "        3RV23 MSPs for starter combinations are motor starter protectors without overload releases. They are always used in conjunction with a contactor and overload relay, as the motor starter protector alone is not able to protect the motor and itself against overloads.\n",
      "        Function\n",
      "        In the event of an overload, the overload relay opens the contactor. The motor starter protector remains on. The motor starter protector will only trip in the event of a short circuit in the feeder.\n",
      "        The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top setting scale). The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor.\n",
      "        In the event of tripping due to overload, an automatic or manual reset can be performed without having to open the control cabinet.\n",
      "        Protection against inrush currents\n",
      "        When control transformers are protected on the primary side, the high inrush currents generated at the time the transformers are switched on often cause spurious tripping in the protective devices. The short-circuit releases of motor starter protectors for transformer protection (3RV24, 3RV28) are set to a higher value than in the case of the 3RV20 motor starter protectors. This avoids unintentional releases otherwise caused by high inrush currents. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This version of motor starter protector is not necessary in the case of control transformers with low inrush currents. In such cases, 3RV20 motor starter protectors can be used for motor protection.\n",
      "        3RV2 motor starter protectors satisfy the features of main switches according to IEC 60947‐2. 3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        In order to prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the charge applied to each of the three current paths must always be the same. With single-phase loads, connect the current paths in series.\n",

      "        The tripping characteristic of 3RV10 / 3RV20 / 3RV21 motor starter protectors is primarily designed for protecting three-phase motors.\n",
      "        The rated current In of the motor to be protected (see nameplate) is set on the setting\n",
      "        scale. The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top value on the setting scale). This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device.\n",
      "        The phase loss sensitivity (not in the case of 3RV20..-.....-0DA0, 3RV23, 3RV27 and 3RV28) of the motor starter protector ensures that it trips in good time in the event of a phase failure or significant phase unbalance. The motor starter protector tripping prevents overcurrents from occurring in the remaining phases, thus preventing damage to the load.\n",
      "        System protection\n",
      "        3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        To prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the load applied to each of the three current paths of the motor starter protector in standard version must always be the same. With single-phase loads, the current paths must be connected in series. There are also motor starter protectors 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 without phase loss sensitivity specially developed for system protection. The 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 motor starter protectors for system protection do not have UL approval and are only suitable for applications according to IEC.\n",
      "        3RV27 and 3RV28 circuit breakers are also suitable for protecting systems. The devices do not possess any phase failure detection and are also approved as Circuit Breaker in accordance with UL 489 or CSA C22.2 No.5.\n",
      "        Motor protection with overload relay function\n",
      "        3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function have the same overload and short- circuit release characteristic as 3RV20 motor starter protectors. However, the overload releases have no effect on the motor starter protectors' breaker latching mechanism. In the event of an overload, the motor starter protector remains on.\n",
      "        The overload release is linked to two auxiliary contacts (1 NO contact + 1 NC contact) mounted on the side; these are switched in the event of an overload. The auxiliary contacts can be evaluated or can be used to disconnect a downstream contactor. The auxiliary contacts are reset automatically once the motor starter protector has cooled down. In the overload range the motor starter protector with overload relay function does not protect itself. Provision has to be made, therefore, to ensure that the current is safely disconnected by a downstream switching device such as a contactor. Note\n",
      "        Fixed connection: Auxiliary contacts with motor starter protector\n",
      "        The auxiliary contacts are connected to the right-hand side of the motor starter protector. The connection is fixed and cannot be removed.\n",
      "        This means that auxiliary releases cannot be mounted on the right-hand side of 3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function.\n",
      "        General information on the startup characteristics of highly energy- efficient motors (IE3 / IE4)\n",
      "        Motor starter protectors have been conceived to protect and switch motors. They assume the task of line protection in the event of an overload or short-circuit.\n",
      "        To this end, motor starter protectors are equipped with sensors for overload and short-circuit detection and possess an interruption point for switching motor and short-circuit currents. Without technical adaptation to the new highly energy-efficient motors (IE3 / IE4), the problems described below can arise.\n",
      "        Short-circuit detection\n",
      "        In the event of unusually high currents in the electrical installation, short-circuit detection serves to keep the thermal and dynamic load low and ensure safe shutdown. The response threshold should lie above the currents that a starting motor causes. The dimensioning of a system is influenced by the response value. The higher the response value, the higher the chosen cable cross-sections to be protected must be. This increases costs in the system and for the switching devices. This is why the response values have been adapted to the previously typical motor starting currents. The drawback of the new, more efficient motors (IE3 / IE4) is that, on average, the starting currents and magnetization currents (inrush currents) arising at the moment of switching on are considerably higher than in the case of the previous generations of motors. The spread of locked rotor and inrush currents is very wide. Motors with high values can therefore cause the motor starter protector's short-circuit detection to respond. This leads to unintentional shutdown (\"early tripping\") during motor starting. Early tripping can occur whenever the motor current lies in the top range of the motor starter protector's setting scale and a motor with a high inrush current is used.\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity of motor starter protectors\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity tests are conducted in compliance with the standard under three- phase AC loading with 10 to 8 times the rated current. In some cases, the starting and inrush currents of IE3 / IE4 motors are clearly above these values. In isolated cases, current spikes that arise during switching on can cause brief lifting of the contacts without triggering a breaking operation by short-circuit detection. This can lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Where the motor is switched on by a contactor, for example, the motor starter protector's making/breaking capacity is irrelevant. In this case, the motor current is only carried. The current that can be carried without any problems is normally higher than the switching device's making/breaking capacity. This should not lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Rated motor current/setting scale\n",
      "        For motor protection, the motor's rated current must be set on the motor starter protector's setting scale. The new IE3 / IE4 motors generally have lower rated currents. This can lead to situations in which a motor starter protector with a lower rated current has to be chosen for the same motor rating. Thus, the short-circuit detection (Page 67) response value also drops and can lead to tripping during motor starting.\n",
      "        Optimization of 3RV1011 and 3RV2 motor starter protectors for IE3 / IE4 motors\n",
      "        The motor starter protectors have been revised in relation to the higher locked rotor currents and inrush currents as follows:\n",
      "        • Raising of the lower short-circuit detection response tolerances without changes to the maximum values.\n",
      "        → No change of customer-end system dimensioning.\n",
      "        • Adaptation of making/breaking capacity.\n",
      "        → For necessary restrictions of maximum locked rotor currents, see the chapter entitled \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\".\n",
      "        • Adaptation of some motor starter protector versions' overload releases and setting scales. → Avoidance of using smaller motor starter protectors due to lower rated motor currents (see chapter \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\")\n",
      "        In the case of motors with very high locked rotor and inrush currents, problems can arise despite adaptations, e.g. undesired tripping on starting. It is recommended that motor starter protectors be selected such that the setting does not need to be made in the upper range of the setting scale. This reduces power loss in the device (cost saving and reduced temperature rise in the control cabinet) and increases the distance from the short-circuit releases' response limits.\n",
      "        Selection example (size S0)\n",
      "        Rated motor current: 15 A\n",
      "        Motor starter protector A: Setting scale 10 ... 16 A Motor starter protector B: Setting scale 13 ... 20 A\n",
      "        → Recommended motor starter protector 13 ... 20 A because of reduced power loss and greater distance from response limits.\n",
      "        In the calculation example, the power loss in the case of motor starter protector B is lower by about 35 % than in the case of motor starter protector A.\n",
      "        The short-circuit releases' response limits always refer to the maximum set value.\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector A, the short-circuit release's response value is 208 A (13 · 16 A).\n",
      "        When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 13.86 times the current setting (208 A/15 A =13.86).\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector B, the short-circuit release's response limit is 260 A\n",
      "        (13 · 20 A). When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 17.33 times the current setting (260 A/15 A = 17.33).\n",
      "        In this example, the distance from the response limit of 13.86 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector A increases to 17.33 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector B.\n",
      "        3RV23 MSP for starter combinations\n",
      "        3RV23 MSPs for starter combinations are motor starter protectors without overload releases. They are always used in conjunction with a contactor and overload relay, as the motor starter protector alone is not able to protect the motor and itself against overloads.\n",
      "        Function\n",
      "        In the event of an overload, the overload relay opens the contactor. The motor starter protector remains on. The motor starter protector will only trip in the event of a short circuit in the feeder.\n",
      "        The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top setting scale). The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor.\n",
      "        In the event of tripping due to overload, an automatic or manual reset can be performed without having to open the control cabinet.\n",
      "        Protection against inrush currents\n",
      "        When control transformers are protected on the primary side, the high inrush currents generated at the time the transformers are switched on often cause spurious tripping in the protective devices. The short-circuit releases of motor starter protectors for transformer protection (3RV24, 3RV28) are set to a higher value than in the case of the 3RV20 motor starter protectors. This avoids unintentional releases otherwise caused by high inrush currents. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This version of motor starter protector is not necessary in the case of control transformers with low inrush currents. In such cases, 3RV20 motor starter protectors can be used for motor protection.\n",
      "        3RV2 motor starter protectors satisfy the features of main switches according to IEC 60947‐2. 3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        In order to prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the charge applied to each of the three current paths must always be the same. With single-phase loads, connect the current paths in series.\n",
      "        Specially developed 3RV20..-.....-0BA0 motor starter protectors without phase loss sensitivity are available for system protection.\n",

      "        The tripping characteristic of 3RV10 / 3RV20 / 3RV21 motor starter protectors is primarily designed for protecting three-phase motors.\n",
      "        The rated current In of the motor to be protected (see nameplate) is set on the setting\n",
      "        scale. The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top value on the setting scale). This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device.\n",
      "        The phase loss sensitivity (not in the case of 3RV20..-.....-0DA0, 3RV23, 3RV27 and 3RV28) of the motor starter protector ensures that it trips in good time in the event of a phase failure or significant phase unbalance. The motor starter protector tripping prevents overcurrents from occurring in the remaining phases, thus preventing damage to the load.\n",
      "        System protection\n",
      "        3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        To prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the load applied to each of the three current paths of the motor starter protector in standard version must always be the same. With single-phase loads, the current paths must be connected in series. There are also motor starter protectors 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 without phase loss sensitivity specially developed for system protection. The 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 motor starter protectors for system protection do not have UL approval and are only suitable for applications according to IEC.\n",
      "        3RV27 and 3RV28 circuit breakers are also suitable for protecting systems. The devices do not possess any phase failure detection and are also approved as Circuit Breaker in accordance with UL 489 or CSA C22.2 No.5.\n",
      "        Motor protection with overload relay function\n",
      "        3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function have the same overload and short- circuit release characteristic as 3RV20 motor starter protectors. However, the overload releases have no effect on the motor starter protectors' breaker latching mechanism. In the event of an overload, the motor starter protector remains on.\n",
      "        The overload release is linked to two auxiliary contacts (1 NO contact + 1 NC contact) mounted on the side; these are switched in the event of an overload. The auxiliary contacts can be evaluated or can be used to disconnect a downstream contactor. The auxiliary contacts are reset automatically once the motor starter protector has cooled down. In the overload range the motor starter protector with overload relay function does not protect itself. Provision has to be made, therefore, to ensure that the current is safely disconnected by a downstream switching device such as a contactor. Note\n",
      "        Fixed connection: Auxiliary contacts with motor starter protector\n",
      "        The auxiliary contacts are connected to the right-hand side of the motor starter protector. The connection is fixed and cannot be removed.\n",
      "        This means that auxiliary releases cannot be mounted on the right-hand side of 3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function.\n",
      "        General information on the startup characteristics of highly energy- efficient motors (IE3 / IE4)\n",
      "        Motor starter protectors have been conceived to protect and switch motors. They assume the task of line protection in the event of an overload or short-circuit.\n",
      "        To this end, motor starter protectors are equipped with sensors for overload and short-circuit detection and possess an interruption point for switching motor and short-circuit currents. Without technical adaptation to the new highly energy-efficient motors (IE3 / IE4), the problems described below can arise.\n",
      "        Short-circuit detection\n",
      "        In the event of unusually high currents in the electrical installation, short-circuit detection serves to keep the thermal and dynamic load low and ensure safe shutdown. The response threshold should lie above the currents that a starting motor causes. The dimensioning of a system is influenced by the response value. The higher the response value, the higher the chosen cable cross-sections to be protected must be. This increases costs in the system and for the switching devices. This is why the response values have been adapted to the previously typical motor starting currents. The drawback of the new, more efficient motors (IE3 / IE4) is that, on average, the starting currents and magnetization currents (inrush currents) arising at the moment of switching on are considerably higher than in the case of the previous generations of motors. The spread of locked rotor and inrush currents is very wide. Motors with high values can therefore cause the motor starter protector's short-circuit detection to respond. This leads to unintentional shutdown (\"early tripping\") during motor starting. Early tripping can occur whenever the motor current lies in the top range of the motor starter protector's setting scale and a motor with a high inrush current is used.\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity of motor starter protectors\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity tests are conducted in compliance with the standard under three- phase AC loading with 10 to 8 times the rated current. In some cases, the starting and inrush currents of IE3 / IE4 motors are clearly above these values. In isolated cases, current spikes that arise during switching on can cause brief lifting of the contacts without triggering a breaking operation by short-circuit detection. This can lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Where the motor is switched on by a contactor, for example, the motor starter protector's making/breaking capacity is irrelevant. In this case, the motor current is only carried. The current that can be carried without any problems is normally higher than the switching device's making/breaking capacity. This should not lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Rated motor current/setting scale\n",
      "        For motor protection, the motor's rated current must be set on the motor starter protector's setting scale. The new IE3 / IE4 motors generally have lower rated currents. This can lead to situations in which a motor starter protector with a lower rated current has to be chosen for the same motor rating. Thus, the short-circuit detection (Page 67) response value also drops and can lead to tripping during motor starting.\n",
      "        Optimization of 3RV1011 and 3RV2 motor starter protectors for IE3 / IE4 motors\n",
      "        The motor starter protectors have been revised in relation to the higher locked rotor currents and inrush currents as follows:\n",
      "        • Raising of the lower short-circuit detection response tolerances without changes to the maximum values.\n",
      "        → No change of customer-end system dimensioning.\n",
      "        • Adaptation of making/breaking capacity.\n",
      "        → For necessary restrictions of maximum locked rotor currents, see the chapter entitled \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\".\n",
      "        • Adaptation of some motor starter protector versions' overload releases and setting scales. → Avoidance of using smaller motor starter protectors due to lower rated motor currents (see chapter \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\")\n",
      "        In the case of motors with very high locked rotor and inrush currents, problems can arise despite adaptations, e.g. undesired tripping on starting. It is recommended that motor starter protectors be selected such that the setting does not need to be made in the upper range of the setting scale. This reduces power loss in the device (cost saving and reduced temperature rise in the control cabinet) and increases the distance from the short-circuit releases' response limits.\n",
      "        Selection example (size S0)\n",
      "        Rated motor current: 15 A\n",
      "        Motor starter protector A: Setting scale 10 ... 16 A Motor starter protector B: Setting scale 13 ... 20 A\n",
      "        → Recommended motor starter protector 13 ... 20 A because of reduced power loss and greater distance from response limits.\n",
      "        In the calculation example, the power loss in the case of motor starter protector B is lower by about 35 % than in the case of motor starter protector A.\n",
      "        The short-circuit releases' response limits always refer to the maximum set value.\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector A, the short-circuit release's response value is 208 A (13 · 16 A).\n",
      "        When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 13.86 times the current setting (208 A/15 A =13.86).\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector B, the short-circuit release's response limit is 260 A\n",
      "        (13 · 20 A). When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 17.33 times the current setting (260 A/15 A = 17.33).\n",
      "        In this example, the distance from the response limit of 13.86 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector A increases to 17.33 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector B.\n",
      "        3RV23 MSP for starter combinations\n",
      "        3RV23 MSPs for starter combinations are motor starter protectors without overload releases. They are always used in conjunction with a contactor and overload relay, as the motor starter protector alone is not able to protect the motor and itself against overloads.\n",
      "        Function\n",
      "        In the event of an overload, the overload relay opens the contactor. The motor starter protector remains on. The motor starter protector will only trip in the event of a short circuit in the feeder.\n",
      "        The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top setting scale). The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor.\n",
      "        In the event of tripping due to overload, an automatic or manual reset can be performed without having to open the control cabinet.\n",
      "        Protection against inrush currents\n",
      "        When control transformers are protected on the primary side, the high inrush currents generated at the time the transformers are switched on often cause spurious tripping in the protective devices. The short-circuit releases of motor starter protectors for transformer protection (3RV24, 3RV28) are set to a higher value than in the case of the 3RV20 motor starter protectors. This avoids unintentional releases otherwise caused by high inrush currents. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This version of motor starter protector is not necessary in the case of control transformers with low inrush currents. In such cases, 3RV20 motor starter protectors can be used for motor protection.\n",
      "        3RV2 motor starter protectors satisfy the features of main switches according to IEC 60947‐2. 3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        In order to prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the charge applied to each of the three current paths must always be the same. With single-phase loads, connect the current paths in series.\n",

      "        Motor protection\n",
      "        The tripping characteristic of 3RV10 / 3RV20 / 3RV21 motor starter protectors is primarily designed for protecting three-phase motors.\n",
      "        The rated current In of the motor to be protected (see nameplate) is set on the setting\n",
      "        scale. The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top value on the setting scale). This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device.\n",
      "        The phase loss sensitivity (not in the case of 3RV20..-.....-0DA0, 3RV23, 3RV27 and 3RV28) of the motor starter protector ensures that it trips in good time in the event of a phase failure or significant phase unbalance. The motor starter protector tripping prevents overcurrents from occurring in the remaining phases, thus preventing damage to the load.\n",
      "        System protection\n",
      "        3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        To prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the load applied to each of the three current paths of the motor starter protector in standard version must always be the same. With single-phase loads, the current paths must be connected in series. There are also motor starter protectors 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 without phase loss sensitivity specially developed for system protection. The 3RV20..-.....-0DA0 motor starter protectors for system protection do not have UL approval and are only suitable for applications according to IEC.\n",
      "        3RV27 and 3RV28 circuit breakers are also suitable for protecting systems. The devices do not possess any phase failure detection and are also approved as Circuit Breaker in accordance with UL 489 or CSA C22.2 No.5.\n",
      "        Motor protection with overload relay function\n",
      "        3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function have the same overload and short- circuit release characteristic as 3RV20 motor starter protectors. However, the overload releases have no effect on the motor starter protectors' breaker latching mechanism. In the event of an overload, the motor starter protector remains on.\n",
      "        The overload release is linked to two auxiliary contacts (1 NO contact + 1 NC contact) mounted on the side; these are switched in the event of an overload. The auxiliary contacts can be evaluated or can be used to disconnect a downstream contactor. The auxiliary contacts are reset automatically once the motor starter protector has cooled down. In the overload range the motor starter protector with overload relay function does not protect itself. Provision has to be made, therefore, to ensure that the current is safely disconnected by a downstream switching device such as a contactor. Note\n",
      "        Fixed connection: Auxiliary contacts with motor starter protector\n",
      "        The auxiliary contacts are connected to the right-hand side of the motor starter protector. The connection is fixed and cannot be removed.\n",
      "        This means that auxiliary releases cannot be mounted on the right-hand side of 3RV21 motor starter protectors with overload relay function.\n",
      "        General information on the startup characteristics of highly energy- efficient motors (IE3 / IE4)\n",
      "        Motor starter protectors have been conceived to protect and switch motors. They assume the task of line protection in the event of an overload or short-circuit.\n",
      "        To this end, motor starter protectors are equipped with sensors for overload and short-circuit detection and possess an interruption point for switching motor and short-circuit currents. Without technical adaptation to the new highly energy-efficient motors (IE3 / IE4), the problems described below can arise.\n",
      "        Short-circuit detection\n",
      "        In the event of unusually high currents in the electrical installation, short-circuit detection serves to keep the thermal and dynamic load low and ensure safe shutdown. The response threshold should lie above the currents that a starting motor causes. The dimensioning of a system is influenced by the response value. The higher the response value, the higher the chosen cable cross-sections to be protected must be. This increases costs in the system and for the switching devices. This is why the response values have been adapted to the previously typical motor starting currents. The drawback of the new, more efficient motors (IE3 / IE4) is that, on average, the starting currents and magnetization currents (inrush currents) arising at the moment of switching on are considerably higher than in the case of the previous generations of motors. The spread of locked rotor and inrush currents is very wide. Motors with high values can therefore cause the motor starter protector's short-circuit detection to respond. This leads to unintentional shutdown (\"early tripping\") during motor starting. Early tripping can occur whenever the motor current lies in the top range of the motor starter protector's setting scale and a motor with a high inrush current is used.\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity of motor starter protectors\n",
      "        Making and breaking capacity tests are conducted in compliance with the standard under three- phase AC loading with 10 to 8 times the rated current. In some cases, the starting and inrush currents of IE3 / IE4 motors are clearly above these values. In isolated cases, current spikes that arise during switching on can cause brief lifting of the contacts without triggering a breaking operation by short-circuit detection. This can lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Where the motor is switched on by a contactor, for example, the motor starter protector's making/breaking capacity is irrelevant. In this case, the motor current is only carried. The current that can be carried without any problems is normally higher than the switching device's making/breaking capacity. This should not lead to welding of the contacts.\n",
      "        Rated motor current/setting scale\n",
      "        For motor protection, the motor's rated current must be set on the motor starter protector's setting scale. The new IE3 / IE4 motors generally have lower rated currents. This can lead to situations in which a motor starter protector with a lower rated current has to be chosen for the same motor rating. Thus, the short-circuit detection (Page 67) response value also drops and can lead to tripping during motor starting.\n",
      "        Optimization of 3RV1011 and 3RV2 motor starter protectors for IE3 / IE4 motors\n",
      "        The motor starter protectors have been revised in relation to the higher locked rotor currents and inrush currents as follows:\n",
      "        • Raising of the lower short-circuit detection response tolerances without changes to the maximum values.\n",
      "        → No change of customer-end system dimensioning.\n",
      "        • Adaptation of making/breaking capacity.\n",
      "        → For necessary restrictions of maximum locked rotor currents, see the chapter entitled \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\".\n",
      "        • Adaptation of some motor starter protector versions' overload releases and setting scales. → Avoidance of using smaller motor starter protectors due to lower rated motor currents (see chapter \"Technical modifications/restrictions of 3RV2 motor starter protectors (Page 69)\")\n",
      "        In the case of motors with very high locked rotor and inrush currents, problems can arise despite adaptations, e.g. undesired tripping on starting. It is recommended that motor starter protectors be selected such that the setting does not need to be made in the upper range of the setting scale. This reduces power loss in the device (cost saving and reduced temperature rise in the control cabinet) and increases the distance from the short-circuit releases' response limits.\n",
      "        Selection example (size S0)\n",
      "        Rated motor current: 15 A\n",
      "        Motor starter protector A: Setting scale 10 ... 16 A Motor starter protector B: Setting scale 13 ... 20 A\n",
      "        → Recommended motor starter protector 13 ... 20 A because of reduced power loss and greater distance from response limits.\n",
      "        In the calculation example, the power loss in the case of motor starter protector B is lower by about 35 % than in the case of motor starter protector A.\n",
      "        The short-circuit releases' response limits always refer to the maximum set value.\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector A, the short-circuit release's response value is 208 A (13 · 16 A).\n",
      "        When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 13.86 times the current setting (208 A/15 A =13.86).\n",
      "        In the case of motor starter protector B, the short-circuit release's response limit is 260 A\n",
      "        (13 · 20 A). When the value 15 A is set, the distance from the short-circuit release's response limit is 17.33 times the current setting (260 A/15 A = 17.33).\n",
      "        In this example, the distance from the response limit of 13.86 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector A increases to 17.33 times the current setting in the case of motor starter protector B.\n",
      "        3RV23 MSP for starter combinations\n",
      "        3RV23 MSPs for starter combinations are motor starter protectors without overload releases. They are always used in conjunction with a contactor and overload relay, as the motor starter protector alone is not able to protect the motor and itself against overloads.\n",
      "        Function\n",
      "        In the event of an overload, the overload relay opens the contactor. The motor starter protector remains on. The motor starter protector will only trip in the event of a short circuit in the feeder.\n",
      "        The short-circuit release is factory-set to a multiple of the motor starter protector's rated current (top setting scale). The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This ensures problem-free ramping-up and safe protection for the motor.\n",
      "        In the event of tripping due to overload, an automatic or manual reset can be performed without having to open the control cabinet.\n",
      "        Protection against inrush currents\n",
      "        When control transformers are protected on the primary side, the high inrush currents generated at the time the transformers are switched on often cause spurious tripping in the protective devices. The short-circuit releases of motor starter protectors for transformer protection (3RV24, 3RV28) are set to a higher value than in the case of the 3RV20 motor starter protectors. This avoids unintentional releases otherwise caused by high inrush currents. The response value of the short-circuit release (in A) is lasered onto the front of the device. This version of motor starter protector is not necessary in the case of control transformers with low inrush currents. In such cases, 3RV20 motor starter protectors can be used for motor protection.\n",
      "        3RV2 motor starter protectors satisfy the features of main switches according to IEC 60947‐2. 3RV20 and 3RV21 motor starter protectors are also suitable for protecting systems.\n",
      "        In order to prevent premature tripping caused by phase loss sensitivity, the charge applied to each of the three current paths must always be the same. With single-phase loads, connect the current paths in series.\n",
      "        Specially developed 3RV20..-.....-0BA0 motor starter protectors without phase loss sensitivity are available for system protection.\n",
